    <h1>Bio:</h1>
    <img src="" />

    <p>
        I come from a background of multiple jobs and experience. I attended WSU and while I was there,
        I enlisted in the Army National Guard Reserves. Once college was complete and earned my degree, I was breifly
        in the medical field. Shortly left that once I realized the field wasn't for me. The journey lead me to GC where
        I am now becoming a developer.
